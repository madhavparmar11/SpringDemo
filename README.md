Demo Spring Boot Web Application
This is a simple Spring Boot web application that demonstrates the basic concepts of building a RESTful API with Spring Boot, connecting to an H2 in-memory database, and performing basic CRUD operations on a User entity.

Features
RESTful API: A simple API to manage User entities.
In-memory Database (H2): Uses H2 as an embedded, in-memory database for quick testing and development.
CRUD Operations: Allows creating, reading, and deleting users.
Technologies Used
Java 21 (or your preferred Java version)
Spring Boot 3.x
Maven for dependency management
H2 Database (in-memory)
Spring Data JPA for data persistence
Spring Web for building web applications and RESTful services
